# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

	The purpose of the excel sheet provided may be divided into two parts. The first part discusses and shows perhaps the best possible launch date of a theater based in previous theater outcomes (whether these theaters were a success or a failure)
over several years in order to create a comprehensive report and achieve the best results over several countries. 
	The second part of the analysis focuses on the funding of theater plays. It shows and discusses a plays' funding goal and whether they were able to achieve their goals or not. This provides us with an opportunity to analyze which funding ranges
are acceptable and achievable, and whether a certain number is too high to achieve or too low.

## Analysis and Challenges

	For the first part, best theater launch date, we accumulated data from the beginning of Januray 2009 till December of 2017, with details of outcomes (whether the theater was successful, a failure, or was canceled) in each month of each year. 
A table was created to shows how each month faired over the 8 year period to show what the best possible month to begin a successful theater could begin. I began with filtering the data and statistics with showing only the theather category. 
From the theater category, a table showing how many successful, failed, canceled theaters there were in each month of the 9 years combined. (Without showing each month of each year, we added the grand total of theaters in all of the years, and seperated
the successful, failures, and canceled based on month). 
	The second part, outcomes based on goals, a table was divided based on the number of successful launch dates, number of failures, and number of canceled plays (where there were none). Each of the number of successful and number failed were divided by 
the total amount of projects to create a percentage. This percentage showed how much of these projects were successful based on the total number of projects, in order to show us what could the possible amount or goal a play could strive to achieve realistically. 
Before creating the percentage, the goal was split into 12 parts or 12 ranges (), to show us the best performing or highest successful and achievable goal range, and be as detailed as possible. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the outcomes of launch dates, the month with the highest successful outcomes (or launch dates) was the month of May. The month of May also had the highest number of failures, which would indicate that May is a risky month to launch a theater project,
but might be worth the shot.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

For outcomes based on goals, the data shows that the higher amount of goal requested, the higher chance it fails and the specific goals are not met. The amount that could be mostly achievable is perhaps ranging from 2000$ and 2500$. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Shows only one category or one part of the whole picture.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Table showing outcomes based on country. Graphs showing backers count per parent category / Subcategory
